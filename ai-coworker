lSession title |  AI: Your new incompetent coworker

Are you worried AI would take your job? AI is here, seemingly to stay. But what does that really mean for developers? 
One possibility is that least some of our jobs will be replaced. Another is that AI ends up as your next coworker. 
We all know how impactful both good and bad coworkers can be, and now AI will either be the coworker or influence coworkers dramatically/
So for those who end up with an AI coworker or having to deeply integrate AI into your workflow and potentially your software,
you need to know what's going on!
So tune into this session where you're going to learn why AI is more likely to be your new incompetent coworker than to replace you, 
and what you can do to make your work life easier when everyone is on the AI bandwagon.
We'll look at making the most of AI in all facets of development, not just during coding. We'll also peek into ways to use AI 
so that we and our human coworkers are less apt to blindly rely on it causing negative results.
